That the use of Prophecy, as it was taught and practised by Christ, His Apostles, and Evangelists, was drawn intirely from single and separate prædictions, gathered by them from the books of the Law and the Prophets, and applied, independently on each other, to the several acts and circumstances of the Life of Jesus, as so many distinct proofs of his Divine Mission. And consequently, that His Lordship's pretended chain of Antediluvian Prophecies, is nothing else, but a fancifull conceit, which has no connection at all with the evidences of the Gospel. II. That the Bishop's exposition of his text is forced, unnatural, and inconsistent with the sense of St. Peter, from whose Epistle it is taken. III. That the Historical Interpretation, which He gives to the Account of the Fall, is absurd and contradictory to reason: and that the said account cannot be considered, under any other character, than that of Allegory, Apologue, or Moral Fable. IV. That the Oracles of the Heathen World, which His Lordship declares to have been given out by the Devil, in the form of a Serpent, were all impostures, wholly managed by human craft, without any supernatural aid, or interposition whatsoever.

My birthday 29 years old. I ought to make better use of my time, & hope to spend this year more profitably than the preceding ... I should like to get up at six dress & read the Bible till 1/2 past 7, then sermonize for two hours every other day, on the alternate days read Butler's Analogy Sermon on the creed or some other doctrinal work. From ten till 1/2 past 11 Horace's satires or some other classic, alternate days some scripture history; till past one natural history. Before bed time read a sermon or some practical work of divinity. Any intermediate time reviews or some other modern light reading. Then the history of England & modern Geography in which I am sadly deficient ought to come in ... I read part of Barrow's sermon on the Gunpowder Treason.' (Note provided by Hazel Jones.
