          <h2>Who is Edward Austen Knight?</h2>
          <p>Born in 1767 and thus eight years Jane Austen’s senior, Edward was much the most fortunate of her six brothers. In 1779, when he was twelve, he caught the fancy of Thomas Knight, a rich distant cousin of the Reverend George Austen, and Thomas’s wife Catherine, when they visited the Steventon rectory during their honeymoon. Subsequently, he made frequent visits to the Knights at their splendid estate, Godmersham Park in Kent, and in 1783 he was adopted by the childless couple. After making a four-year Grand Tour and attending Dresden University for a year, in 1791 he married Elizabeth Bridges. On the death of his adoptive father in 1794, he became heir to all of the Knights’ estates, including Chawton House and the Manor Farm in Hampshire, as well as Godmersham Park, and in 1798 he took over full control from his adoptive mother; she moved to Canterbury while he and his growing family moved from Rowling House, Kent, into nearby Godmersham. Edward’s wife died suddenly in 1808, after bearing eleven children; Edward never remarried, and on the death of his adoptive mother in 1812, he changed the family name from Austen to Knight. He remained at Godmersham until his death in 1852, outliving Jane Austen by thirty-five years.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="about_history-godmersham">
          <h2>History of Godmersham Park</h2>
          <p>Some eight miles southwest of Canterbury, Godmersham Park is a fine Palladian building, dating from about 1732. Its extensive grounds include woods and a large deer park. It was built for Thomas Knight, father of the Thomas Knight who adopted Edward Austen, who had changed his name twice: from Brodnax to May and then from May to Knight. Shortly before his death in 1781, Thomas Knight senior added two matching wings, each with five windows, to the front of the house; the western wing held a kitchen and household offices while the east wing housed a long library. On the death of Edward (Austen) Knight in 1852, his heir, Edward Knight Junior, inherited Godmersham, but lived at another of the Knight estates, Chawton House in Hampshire. In 1874 he sold Godmersham, which has since had a succession of owners. The house survives today, but the library, regrettably, is no more. It was in ruins by 1920, when H. Avray Tipping described it in Country Life as “abandoned and decayed,” although it still contained three immense bookcases, each about fifteen feet wide, in their original positions. Later in the twentieth century the bookcases were removed and the library divided into a series of rooms, which are now used as offices by the Association of British Dispensing Opticians.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="about_history-library">
          <h2>History of the Library (before Jane)</h2>
          <p>The Library at Godmersham Park housed the books collected over some two hundred years by the Broadnax (later May and then Knight) family, who had owned the Manor of Godmersham since 1590. In 1793, it was described in a guidebook by Zechariah Cozens as “a most excellent library.” When he moved to Godmersham in 1798, Edward Austen inherited a collection of some 1,200 books (many of these in multi-volume sets), to which he and his descendants continued to add. It contained standard works of English, French, and ancient Greek and Roman literature, as well as books in Italian, and some in Spanish and German. Some of the books published on the Continent were purchased by Edward during his Grand Tour of 1786-90. The library was well stocked with biographical, historical, geographical, theological and travel writings, as well as books about architecture and painting, science and medicine, farming, horsemanship, agriculture, gardening, landscape, and leisure pursuits, such as treatises on whist and chess. Reference works included sets of periodicals, dictionaries, atlases, and parliamentary records. The range is typical of country-house collections of the time, although the number of novels, including ones by Jane Austen’s contemporaries and recent predecessors, is surprisingly high.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="about_library-jane">
          <h2>Jane and the Library</h2>
          <p>Jane Austen visited Godmersham Park on six occasions over a fifteen-year period, from 1798 to 1813, staying there for a total of about ten months. Her first visit, accompanied by her parents and her sister Cassandra, was for a two-month stay from late August to late October 1798, just weeks after her brother Edward took possession of the estate. She was next at Godmersham, again with her parents and Cassandra, for a month, in September-October 1803. In 1805, following her father’s death, she was there with Cassandra and their mother for three months, from mid-June to mid-September; this was the longest of her visits. In 1808 she went on her own for three weeks, from mid-June to early July, recording her impressions of Godmersham Park and its library in letters to Cassandra. In 1809 she visited Godmersham Park with Cassandra and their mother for six weeks, from mid-May until the end of June. Her final stay was for two months, from mid-September to mid-November 1809. During this visit she wrote to Cassandra that “we live in the Library except at Meals & have a fire every Eveng.” On another occasion she rejoiced in having sole possession of the library, with “five Tables, Eight and twenty Chairs & two fires all to myself.”</p>
        </div>
        <div id="about_library-post-jane">
          <h2>The Library after Jane</h2>
          <p>After the death of Edward Knight in 1852 and before the eventual sale of Godmersham Park in 1874, Edward Knight junior moved the books to the library at his Hampshire estate, Chawton House, where they combined with the books in his own collection there. After Edward junior’s son Montagu George Knight inherited Chawton House in 1879, he had hand-made shelf tickets attached to the books, indicating their positions on the library shelves. In 1900, he also began affixing his bookplates, of which he had three, to many of the volumes, thus helping us to identify them today. After the death of Montagu George Knight in 1914, the library was gradually dispersed by succeeding generations. Many of the books listed in the 1818 catalogue are missing in a new catalogue compiled in 1908. Some fifty items were dispersed at a Sotheby’s auction of 9 July 1935, and further volumes were sold piecemeal in the latter part of the twentieth century. Nonetheless, well over a third of the works listed in the catalogue, about five hundred titles in all, are extant in the present-day Knight Collection, on loan to Chawton House Library from their owner Richard Knight, the great-great-great-grandson of Jane Austen’s brother Edward Knight.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="about_catalogue">
          <h2>The Catalogue</h2>
          <p>In 1818, a year after Jane Austen’s death, Edward Knight began compiling a catalogue of his library. It consists of two leather-bound volumes, each with the date 1818 embossed on the cover.
          <img src="" alt="MAIN CATALOGUE">
          The first catalogue lists the books, based on the title on the spine, in their shelf order: east, west, or south side of the library, columns from left to right, and shelf, from floor to ceiling. The catalogue is not a perfect record: the unknown principal compiler misspelled some titles (especially non-English ones) and authors’ names. Sometimes, the compiler made errors converting Roman to Arabic numerals, or omitted the date altogether. The compiler also recorded the place of publication and the “size” of each work: folio, quarto, octavo or duodecimo.
          <img src="" alt="ALPHABETICAL CATALOGUE">
          The second volume lists authors alphabetically, along with their corresponding works and shelf locations . Its principal compiler, whose identity is also unknown, apparently worked exclusively from the first volume, without consulting books on the shelves, since all of its errors are reproduced. It is alphabetized only by the initial letter of the name; after that, volumes are listed in the order in which they occur in the first catalogue. The volumes are written in two distinct secretarial hands. At least two further hands made additions in each of the volumes as further books were acquired, until the 1840s. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="about_lost-sheep">
          <h2>Finding the Lost Sheep of Godmersham</h2>
          <p>In addition to the books in the present-day Knight Collection, some fifty items listed in the 1818 Catalogue are now in libraries and museums, with a few more in private hands. Jane Austen’s House Museum holds the Godmersham Park copies of Jane Austen’s six published novels, while the Godmersham Park Heritage Centre has Mary Hays’s six-volume Female Biography. At least nine libraries in the United States, one in Canada (McGill University), one in England (the British Library) and one in Australia (the University of Melbourne) own one or more ex-Godmersham books: the Harry Ransom Center, Texas, has four and Stanford University Library has three. Other works have been sold in recent years by booksellers and auction houses or are currently (in 2018) on offer: the most important such item is a two-volume edition of poems by William Cowper, one of Austen’s favourite poets. Several individuals, including Janine Barchas, Deborah Barnum and Linda Dennery, have generously bought ex-Godmersham titles and presented them to Chawton House Library, where they have rejoined the volumes in the Knight Collection.
          
          Little did Edward Austen Knight know when he catalogued his fine library at Godmersham Park in 1818, that 200 years later the intense interest in his author sister and modern technology would see this very library available to all via virtual reality. Reading with Austen will put all of us in that same library, giving us a better understanding of the exact works to which Austen had access. How delightful to find any of those titles she mentions in her letters and fiction writings listed in Edward’s catalogue – and even more delightful to have the very book on the shelves of the Library at Chawton House.

          We are trying to locate and bring home the scattered volumes, wherever they may be: in institutional libraries, individual’s private libraries, or on bookseller’s shelves. We are the Godmersham Lost Sheep Society (GLOSS), a research group of scholars and bibliophiles, and we are asking for your help. We Glossers know that all the books cannot be located – so many probably lost to time and chance – but we believe that there are still several hundred waiting to be unearthed. 

          Many of the works in the extant Knight collection can be identified through the Knight family bookplates: Thomas Knight, Edward Knight, and the three bookplates of Montagu George Knight (see here for images and more information on these bookplates). By searching various library catalogues, auction sales, and bookselling sites for this provenance, and by blitzing the book collector airwaves with our “Wanted!” poster, we have been able to locate more than 50 of the missing titles. The institutional copies must remain where they are, but special collections librarians have been most generous in sending us the images we need; other copies we have been able to purchase and return to the Library at Chawton House; and some remain on the market. This searching is an ongoing task as new works continue to appear.
          
          How you can help:

          If you have on your shelves or you locate books with any of the Knight bookplates, please contact us. If you live near a large library (public, academic, museum, etc.), you can search its catalogue or ask the librarian to search for the three named bookplates – these should show up in the provenance section of the catalogue record. We have not searched every possible institution: you could help us do this whenever you find yourself in a library. Then what we will need are good images of:  
          </p>
          <ul>
          <li><p>the binding/cover</p></li>
          <li><p>the inside cover of the book, where the bookplate should be attached, often together with a small shelf ticket</p></li>
          <li><p>the title page of the book, with frontispiece if applicable</p></li>
          <li><p>any marginalia</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          These images will be used on the website 

          If you should have or locate any such books, and would like to “return” the book to Chawton to be part of their permanent collection, you would become part of our growing Society. All donations are tax-deductible. Or, if you would consider selling the book back to Chawton House now or in the future (or making a donation to the cause so we can purchase books as they become available), we would add it to our wish-list of purchases and ask that you send the pictures noted above so it can be added to the website. Progress is slow, and because every book will not be able to return home we hope this virtual Godmersham library will serve as a useful research tool for future studies of reading habits in the 18th and 19th centuries.<p>

          <h3>The Knight Family Bookplates</h3>
          By Deborah Barnum<br>
          August 2018<br><br>
          <p>When young Edward Austen was adopted by Thomas Knight II and his wife Catherine, he inherited more than just the three estates of Godmersham Park, Chawton House, and the Steventon Manor House – he also inherited the Knight family history, a history that included the Brodnax, May, Monke, Martin, Lewkenor, and others.(1)  These histories can be ferreted out by studying the surviving bookplates which are found in many of the books that were in Edward (Austen) Knight’s Godmersham and Chawton libraries.
           
          The Reading with Austen website project has been most successful in locating a number of the missing titles from these libraries by searching for these bookplates, all based on the various family coats-of-arms: those of Thomas Knight, Edward Knight, and Edward’s grandson Montagu George Knight. When this provenance is referenced in library catalogues, auction records, or bookseller lists, we look for the title in the 1818 catalogue of the Godmersham Library, and we are quite beside ourselves, knowing that this very book was on the shelves Jane Austen knew and perused!
           
          So what do these bookplates (also called Ex-libris) tell us?
           
          Excluding some of the heraldic detail (heraldry has a language all its own!) and many of the references to color (which are paramount in the heraldic tradition but the bookplates are only black and white), we will look at the three most important to get a sense of how these multiple family histories are entwined into the symbols and patterns that make each bookplate unique to the individual.
          </p>
          <hr> 
          <p> 
          Thomas Knight I (1701-1781) and Thomas Knight II (1735-1794) – both used the same bookplate and it includes the Knight, Brodnax and May arms, all names Thomas I took in order to inherit various properties:
           
          The Knight arms in the 1st and 4th quarters of the shield consists of a green diagonal band of gold lozenges (in a diamond shape: “the lozenge is a symbol of honesty and constancy and it is also a token of noble birth.” (Parker)), and below the band, a white cinquefoil (a 5-petalled flower, representing hope and joy).
           
          The 2nd quarter is the Brodnax arms, a gold shield with two red chevrons (in the shape of a roof rafter, signifying protection) and with three white cinquefoils above.
           
          The May arms take up the 3rd quarter: a red fesse (a broad straight bar) between six small gold billets (small oblong blocks, representing trustworthiness).
          </p>
          <hr>
          <p> 
          When Edward (Austen) Knight (1767-1852) (Jane Austen’s brother for those confused by all these names) took over the estates of Thomas II in 1812 and officially took the Knight name, he had his own bookplate made – it was engraved by the Wyon family, one of the most prestigious engravers of the time. (Hartley, 334). He combined his Knight, Austen, and Leigh (his mother’s family) heritage into the one design:
           
          In the 1st and 4th quarter her repeats the Knight arms with the addition of a red canton (a square shape) in the top left corner of the shield, this to show he was not directly descended by blood from the Knight family.
           
          The Austen arms comprise the 2nd quarter: though never officially registered, these arms were used by the Rev. George Austen and appear here as a gold shield with a red chevron between three black lion paws.
           
          The Leigh family is represented in the 3rd quarter by a red engrailed (cut edges) cross with a silver lozenge in the top left corner.
           
          Edward also adds two crests from the Knights (the Monk) and the Austens (the Stag). The monk or friar holds a stemmed cinquefoil in his right hand (this was originally a lantern but was changed with the Brodnax connection) with a bracelet of beads (a rosary) and a cross hanging from his left hand, the cross a symbol of faith and the Church. A red rose (a symbol of grace, beauty, and sometimes martyrdom) was also added to the monk’s robe.
           
          The stag was on George Austen’s bookplate and is shown seated upon a coronet (crown).
           
          The motto “Suivant Saint Pierre” (following Saint Peter) is also prominently displayed, this being the Knight motto since 1679.
           
          If one looks at the Knight china that Edward ordered from Wedgwood in September 1813 (see Ltr. 88), the pattern includes both the gold lozenges as a border and the monk crest.
          </p>
         <hr>
           <p>
          Edward’s son, known as Edward Knight, Jr. (1794-1879), used the same bookplate as his father as far as is known – there are some books with this bookplate but with Edward Jr’s signature. But his son, Montagu George Knight (MGK) (1844-1914), created his own, playing with all the family arms and added even more to the mix.
          MGK had three bookplates engraved by the very prominent engraver Charles W. Sherborn. The first one seen here was done in 1900, the second rectangular one in 1901 – both of these are quite rare.
           
          The third armorial circular bookplate, in the style of an ancient seal, is the most commonly seen, Montagu putting it in many of those books that remained in the combined library collection once Godmersham was sold in 1874. This plate shows all the heraldic elements of the family heritage with the addition of the arms of the family of his wife Florence Hardy:
           
          The helmet is in profile with the visor closed, as is appropriate for either an esquire or private gentleman. The shield is slanted and includes on the dexter side (right side of shield, but the left side to the spectator) all the arms from Edward’s bookplate: the two Knights, Brodnax, and May. The sinister side (left side, right to spectator) contains the arms of the Hardy family (Charles Hardy of Chilham Castle): a red shield with three barred leopard heads in silver and a slanting bar covered with three gold Catherine wheels (Catherine refers to St. Catherine, a Christian martyr, and serves as an emblem of one’s willingness to undergo great trials for their Christian faith).
           
          MGK, following his grandfather, uses the monk crest with the rosary and cross, the cinquefoil and the red rose on the robe.
           
          There are a few items undetermined: the three different symbols on the helmet, and the meaning of the leaves. These might just be decorative touches, but if anyone has information please contact me through the website.
           
          Two interesting bits about Jane Austen: the lozenge symbol is said to signify persuasion. And the rose, in “the very ancient rolls, is chiefly borne by branches of the one family of the D'arcys.” (Parker). One can only wonder at this significance.…
           
          1. This is a very brief summary of the three Knight bookplates that have been found in the books of both the Godmersham Park and Chawton Manor libraries. For a more complete history of the various families, see Chawton Manor and Its Owners: A Family History, by William Austen Leigh and Montagu George Knight, published in 1911, as well as other works in the bibliography, especially those of Edward Hepper who was very gracious in sharing all his heraldic and Knight knowledge with me.</p>

          <h2>Recreating the Look of the Library / Making of</h2>
          <p>
          [A digital catalogue created by XX and XX
          Correcting the transcription
          Calculating shelf sizes by estimating number of books on the shelf]

          How do you recreate a library when no visual record and little documentation of it exists? Our reimagining is based on snippets of description, floor plans, and photographs of other rooms at Godmersham Park taken from both nineteenth-century and contemporary sources. 

          In a letter to Cassandra dated 3 November 1813, Jane Austen mentions “five Tables, Eight and twenty Chairs & two fires” in the library. By looking at maps of the building, the layout of the long, rectangular room with its two fireplaces on the south wall becomes more clear.

          <img src="" alt="FLOORPLAN">

          An 1874 auction catalogue also notes the dimensions of the “lofty library”: 
          
          <img src="" alt="LOFTY LIBRARY">

          In 1920, Henry Avray Tipping described Godmersham Park in detail and included several photos in his article “Country Homes, Gardens Old and New: Godmersham Park, Kent, the Property of Lord Masham.” He mentions the “great bookcases” of “the same period [1793] and in the style” of the “rusticated gate-posts...topped with caps and urns in the manner of Robert Adam.” Based on this hint, we’ve tried to evoke Adam’s neoclassical style in the drawing of our library shelves. These shelves, according to Tipping, are “about 15 ft. wide, those at either end of the room being straight fronted, but that occupying the middle position between the chimneypieces has a deep centre and diminishing sides, a form that greatly enhances the effect in its position between the slightly projecting chimney-breasts” (cite). Unfortunately no photographs accompany this description. 

          In the absence of definitive information, our artistic rendering of the Godmersham Park Library takes a lot of creative license, while trying to be as historically accurate as possible with the resources available.
          
          <img src="" alt="GODMERSHAM PARK HALL" class="about_img__inline">

          This photograph, taken from Tipping’s article, depicts Godmersham Park’s hall, unaltered since the 1720s. The details of the fireplace and door lintels were incorporated into our library’s decorations. 

          We based our other aesthetic decisions on period-appropriate furnishings, such as this globe by popular late eighteenth-century London artisan William Barden and his son Thomas.

          Perhaps the most important aspect of our library recreation, however, was the construction of the bookshelves: we wanted to replicate them to scale in order to give the best sense of how they would have looked to Austen when she visited. This was especially challenging as the only information we had to work with was the general size of each case - “about 15 feet wide,” according to Tipping in Country Life – and information we could infer from the Godmersham catalogue itself. 
        
          <img src="" alt="BOOK LOCATION" class="about_img__inline">

          First, we counted the number of volumes that the catalogue listed on each shelf. Multi-volume sets are identified after their title; otherwise each book is comprised of a single volume. Then we allotted each volume a width of one inch – a rough average to account for volumes both fat and thin. This allowed us to arrive at an estimate of the width of each shelf. So this section of the shelf – with 2 single-volume titles, one three-volume title, and one twenty-five volume title – measures 30 inches across. 

          <img src="" alt="BOOK FORMAT" class="about_img__inline">

          The catalogue also lists the format of each volume, so by deciding on an average height for each format – folio volumes are 20 inches, quartos are 12 inches, etc – we inferred the minimum height of each shelf. In this example, the tallest volume on the shelf is an octavo, so we have made the shelf nine inches tall. These somewhat arbitrary measurements are useful for their relative difference, revealing that some shelves would necessarily be much taller or wider than others. 

          Some mysteries remained, however, such as what the “slips” in the catalogue indicated, which were listed either before or after the columns of each case. We consulted both books and experts on eighteenth- and nineteenth-century architecture, but we could never determine with certainty what they were. In the end, based on photos of other library shelves of the period, we decided slips must be narrower mini-shelves. To provide consistency across the slips in all three book cases, we decided to place them on either side of the central column, but there was no easy or obvious solution. 

          Our calculations were key for creating the visual and technical aspects of the site. [link to site credits].

          Because we know where some of these books were located (see bookplates and x section above), we could then arrange for photographs to be taken. A combination of research assistants, volunteers, librarians, and archivists gathered, sorted, and cropped hundreds of photos of the spines, title pages, book plates, and sometimes even marginalia of the extant books. On Reading with Austen, these extant books are represented on the shelves by their spines. Missing volumes are represented by a generic spine image. 


          Where a book is extant, it is represented on the hand-drawn shelves by a photograph of its spine. These spines are clickable, redirecting you to a page with bibliographic information on the volume, photographs of its title pages, and, where they exist, book plates and marginalia. Books not known to be extant are represented on the shelves by a stock spine as a visual placeholder and will still be clickable, taking you to a page that will include as much information as we have on that volume. Where possible, we include links to full digital editions available on open-access websites like Google Books, Archive.org, and HathiTrust.

          <h2>Data Description</h2>
          <p>Our data is based on a spreadsheet developed from the main catalogue. Working off a transcription created by XXXX and XXX, we modified the transcriptions, adding obliterated entries, correcting transcription errors, and assigning an identification number to each entry based on its shelf location. 

          We then matched these catalogue entries to photographs of various works, a process made more difficult by the many complex elements of eighteenth-century printing such as multiple title pages and similar editions. Once we established a match, we transcribed the title page with all of its metadata, collecting information about the title, author, and publication, and noting any notable marginalia such as Edward Knight’s signatures.

          Only a third of the books were matched, however, leaving us with XXXX books identified by a few words of author and title, along with place and date of publication. For these works, we used a best guess method, relying on resources such as the English Short Title Catalogue and the Copac catalogue.
       
          For all of our entries, we also tried to find links to online editions. We prioritized publicly available resources such as Google Books, Archive.org, and HathiTrust, but if we could not find it available freely online, we turned to resources such as Early English Books Online and Eighteenth Century Collections Online. For some books, we could not find online versions at all.</p>
